# Introduction to Git
ifdef::env-github[:outfilesuffix: .adoc]

Part 1 (chapters 1-2) will fly through the basics of using Git while teaching you the underlying concepts that are often misunderstood or omitted in beginners guides. You may know how to use Git already, but I’d encourage you to persevere with this anyway; it’s setting a good foundation which the rest of the book will build upon.

This part will cover the following topics:

* Why Git was created
* How to create and commit files in a new local Git repository
* How to view the history of a Git repository in command-line or graphical tools
* How to download and upload changes to a remote Git repository
* How to create and merge branches
